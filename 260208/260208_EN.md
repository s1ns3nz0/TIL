- Interface: A contract that denies which functionalities must be implemented
- Implementation: A class that actually implements and fulfills the contract
## 3. Getting started with Cloud-Native Development
#### 3.3.2 Implementing REST APIs using Spring MVC
- Spring MVC handles incoming HTTP requests to specific HTTP methods and resource endpoints through @RestController classes
#### 3.3.3 Data validation and Error handling
- Java Bean validation is a widely used specification for expressing constraints and validation rules on Java objects through annotation
- To handle REST API errors, use Java standard exceptions and define the action to take when exceptions occur through @RestControllerAdvice classes
#### 3.3.4 Evolving APIs to Meet Future Requirements
- Distributed systems require plans for changing and evolving APIs without affecting other application's functionality
- Changes affecting clients are sometimes inevitable. API versioning can be used in such cases
