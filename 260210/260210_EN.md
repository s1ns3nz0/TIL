# Understanding Cloud Environments
## 1. 3-Tier Architecture
```
[Internet] 
    ↓
[Load Balancer] - Public Subnet
    ↓
[Web/App Servers] - Private Subnet (Auto Scaling)
    ↓
[Database] - Private Subnet (Multi-AZ)
```
## 2. 4-Tier Architecture
```
[Internet]
    ↓
[CDN / WAF] - Edge
    ↓
[Load Balancer] - Public Subnet
    ↓
[Web Servers] - Private Subnet (Static resources, Proxies)
    ↓
[App Servers] - Private Subnet (Business logic))
    ↓
[Database] - Private Subnet (Data layer)
```
## 3. Web service standard architecture
```
[Route 53 DNS]
    ↓
[CloudFront CDN]
    ↓
[WAF] - DDoS protection, SQL Injection blocking
    ↓
[ALB] - Public Subnet (Multi-AZ)
    ↓
[Auto Scaling Group] - Private Subnet
  - Web/App EC2 (Golden AMI)
  - Target Tracking: CPU 70% threshold
    ↓
[RDS] - Private Subnet (Multi-AZ, Read Replica)
    ↓
[S3] - Static resource, log, backup
```
## 4. AWS other services
### 1) GuardDuty
- Threat detection services based on machine learning
- VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, DNS log analysis
- Abnormal API calls, cryptomining detection
- Automated response is possible using SNS, Lambda
### 2) Auto Scaling
- Launch Template: Define which AMIs and instance types to use
- Auto Scaling Group: Minimum/Maximum/Desired capacity
- Scaling Policy: when to scale out/in
- Target Tracking: Automatically scales to maintain CPU at 70%
- Step Scaling: Add 2 instaces at CPU 70%, Add 5 instances at CPU 80%
- Scheduled Scaling: 10 instances on weekdays at 9 AM, Scale to 10 instances on weekends at 11 AM
- Predictive Scaling: Proactive scaling by learning patterns with ML

## 5. Resources Acquisition Methods and Necessity
### 1) Necessity
Cost optimization: Detect unused resources(EBS volumes, unattached EIP)
Security: Verify overly permissive security groups and missing patches
Compliance: Track whether compliance requirements are met
Incident response: Identify where resources are located
Change management: Track who changed what and when
### 2) Methods
AWS Config: Track resource change history and verify compliance
CloudTrail: API call logs (Track who did what)
Resource Groups & Tag Editor: Resource grouping based on tags
Systems Manager Inventory: EC2 SW/patch status
Cost Explorer: Cost analysis and forecasting

## 6. Operatoin/Monitoring
### 1) Logs
What: Event records at specific point in time(text)
Example: [ERROR] DB connection timeout at 2025-02-10 14:23:45
Usage: Debugging, Analyze root cause, Audit
Tools: ELK Stack, CloudWatch Logs, Splunk
Characteristics: Detailed but high volume, Requires search and analysis
### 2) Metrics
What: Numeric data over time(number)
Example: CPU usage 70%, 1500 requests per second, response time 120ms
Usage: Trend analysis, alarms, capacity planning
Tools: Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog
Characteristics: Aggregatable, lightweight, easy to visualize
### 3) Tracing
What: Tracking the entire path of requests in distributed system
Example: API Gateway(10ms) → Auth(50ms) → App(200ms) → DB(150ms)
Usage: Identify bottlenecks and dependencies between services
Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray
Characteristics: Connects the entire flow using Trace ID
