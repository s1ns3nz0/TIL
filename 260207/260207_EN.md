# Cloud Native Spring in Action
## (Appendix) A.3 Kubernetes
- Minikube: Enables running local kubernetes cluster on any operating system
- kind: Enables running local kubernetes cluster as docker containers
- k3d: Enables running kubernetes cluster using k3s, a minimal kubernetes distribution by Rancher Labs
## 3. Getting started with Cloud Native Development
### 3.2) Working with embedded server
> Summary of Server-Related terms
> - Web server: A server that processes HTTP requests from clients and returns HTTP responses(e.g., Apache HTTPD)
> - Servlet Container: A component of web server which provides runtime context for web applications such as Spring MVC Apps via Java Servlet API(e.g., Tomcat Catalina)
> - Application Server: A server that provides a comprehensive runtime environment for various types of applications and supports multiple protocols
#### 3.2.1) Excutable JAR and embedded server
- One of the differences between traditional and cloud native approaches is how applications are packaged and deployed
    + Traditionally, Application servers or standalone web servers were used
    + Cloud-Native applications must be standalone and not depend on servers provided by the runtime environment
    + Required server functionality is embedded within the application itself. Spring Boot embed the necessary server functionality, removing external dependencies and help applications become standalone
- Embedded servers used in cloud-native applications typically consist of web server components and runtime context, through which Java web applications interact with the web server
#### 3.2.2) Understanding the Thread-per-Request Model
- Web applications running on servlet containers such as Tomcat handle requests based on thread-per-request model
- For each request, the application allocates a dedicated thread that handles only that specific request. The thread is exclusively used for that purpose until the response is returned to the client and not used for other purposes(synchronous, blocking I/O)
- Tomcat initializes a thread pool through which all HTTP requests are managed. If all threads are busy when new request comes in, the request enters a queue and waits unitl a thread becomes available
- Therefore, The number of Tomcat threads represents the upper limit for handling concurrent requests
- When thread are frequently exhausted, You can handle more requests by adjusting the thread pool configuration
### 3.3 Building RESTful Applications with Spring MVC
- Building cloud-native applications likely involves developing distributed systems composed of multiple interacting microservices that work together for overall system functionality
- The application you develop might be used by services developed by other teams within the organization
#### 3.3.1 REST API First, Business Logic Second
- Adopting the API-first principle makes it easier to evolve applications and adapt to future requirements
- Three core concepts of Business Logic
    + Entity: Represents a noun in a domain, such as a book
    + Service: Defines and Implements use cases for the domain
    + Repository: An abstract layer that allowws the domain layer to access data independently of the data source
