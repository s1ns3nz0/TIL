# Cloud Native Spring in Action
## 1. Cloud Native Fundamentals
### 1.1) What is cloud-native?
- Cloud-native is the method for developing applications to leverage cloud technologies
- 3P of cloud-native
  + Platform: Cloud-native applications are running on a distributed environment, such as public, private, and Hybrid clouds
  + Property: Cloud-native applications are designed to be scalable, elastic, and easily manageable
  + Practice: Changing the system into a frequent, predictable way by robust automation is included, such as Automation, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps
### 1.2) Cloud and Cloud computing model
- Cloud is an IT infrastructure that provides computing resources to customers according to the cloud computing model
- Cloud computing service models: IaaS, CaaS, PaaS, FaaS, SaaS
- Cloud computing deployment models: Private, Public, Hybrid
### 1.3) Characteristics of Cloud-native application
- Scalability: Veritcal(scaling up/down-CPU, Memory), Horizontal(Scaling Out/In-Node, Container)
- Loose coupling: Each component is developed independently. Although one component is changed, Others shouldn't be modified
- Resilience: The capability of a Hardware-Software network to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service encountering errors and issues that prevent normal operation.
- Observability: Considering a system, Observability is how the inside of the system can be measured properly from its output
- Managability: The capability to change the state or output of a system within a finite time through the external input 
### 1.4) Culture and Practices for supporting Cloud-native
- Combined with robust automation, It allows for frequent and predictable deployment of high-impact changes with minimal effort
- Automation: Processes and tasks become repeatable, making system overall more reliable and stable(Infrasctructure as code, Configuration as code)
- Continuous Delivery: A software development discipline that builds software in a way that it can be deployed to production at any time
- DevOps: A culture where people collaborate to plan, develop, deploy and operate systems regardless of their role and background
